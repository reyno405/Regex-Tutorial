# Regex-Tutorial

In this tutorial I will be discussing  Regex. Regex is a set of characters that together make a pattern. They can by used inside of code or algorithms to locate, or even locate and replace if that's what you desire, specific patterns inside of a string. An example of this would be to validate a user's password, identify phone numbers, email addresses, URLs, and so much more.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
